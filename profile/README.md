Shipping serverless applications should be fast and hassle free.

* Ship only whats changed, ship only what necessary
* Build once, deploy many
* Easily rollout changes without downtime, automatically rollback if necessary
* Declaratively control what is deployed across your environments
* Secure your pipeline; increase your security controls and decrease permissions provided
* Spend more time delivering value, and less time downloading, installing, bundling, minifiying, zipping, ... ðŸ’¤
